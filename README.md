# Export format for BlockyThingie

## Map info width, height, tileWidth, tileHeight 
map_width map_heigh tile_width tile_height

## Certain objects on the map
object_name object_x object_y object_width object_height

## Tiles
tile_id, tile_x, tile_y, ...... otherss..

this is still messy because I want to be able to have different tile sizes :)
